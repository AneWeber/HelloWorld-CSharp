# HelloWorld in C# ðŸ‘‹

This project is a simple console application I've built to explore and solidify my understanding of fundamental C# concepts. It's a hands-on way to demonstrate how C# can create interactive experiences, featuring:


- Name Input: Basic user interaction by taking and displaying your name.
- Number Operations: Exploring how C# handles numerical data.
- Character Play: Working with text and individual characters.
